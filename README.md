# Frameworks Overview

\[ English | [简体中文](README_zh-cn.md) \]

This project adopts a top-level repository (super repository) management approach to organize multiple sub-repositories. This method allows for better management and maintenance of different parts of the codebase while ensuring the independence and flexibility of each sub-repository. The sub-repositories are prefixed with the `frameworks` field.

## List of Sub-Repositories

| Sub-repository Link                                              | Description                                                                                                            |
