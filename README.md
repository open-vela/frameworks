# Frameworks Overview

\[ English | [简体中文](README_zh-cn.md) \]

This project adopts a super repository structure to manage multiple sub-repositories. This approach helps better manage and maintain different parts of the codebase while ensuring the independence and flexibility of each sub-repository. The sub-repositories are prefixed with the frameworks field.
